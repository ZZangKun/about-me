      <h2> Bio </h2>
      <p id="pbio"> My name is Jacky Huang, an international student from China, currently studying at St. Anne's-Belfield School. I had robotics experience since childhood and was the programmer in my robotics team, but my true computer science experience started in 2020, starting with c++. Even though it's though, I'm often excited to try and explore the world of CS.<p>
        <p id="pbio"> In my free time, I like to travel and watch airplanes as a flight enthusiast. I also like to take planes to different places! I have many beautiful photos of planes that I will show it at the bottom of this webpage. </p>
      <p id="pbio"> This website includes my personal bio, my CS projects and links to their github page, and some photos of my airplanes. </p>
