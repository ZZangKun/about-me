      <h2> Bio </h2>
      <p id="pbio"> My name is Jacky Huang, an international student from China, currently studying at St. Anne's-Belfield School. I had robotics experience since childhood and was the programmer in my robotics team, but my true computer science experience started in 2020, starting with c++. Even though it's though, I'm often excited to try and explore the world of CS.<p>
        <p id="pbio"> In my free time, I like to travel and watch airplanes as a flight enthusiast. I also like to take planes to different places! I have many beautiful photos of planes that I will show it at the bottom of this webpage. </p>
      <p id="pbio"> This website includes my personal bio, my CS projects and links to their github page, and some photos of my airplanes. </p>

    <h3>Twentyfour Calculator</h3>
    <div class="project_des">Calculate twentyfour is a game that randomly picks four card, and you will need to calculate 24 using all the four numbers with +, -, *, or /. This calculator is written in c++ that calculates the output and shows the detailed process. For example, if you input 1, 2, 3, 4, the output will be 2+1=3
3+3=6
6*4=24. I did this project in my freshman year in highschool, but it's only working for most of the time; sometimes it will produce error(still fixing that!).</div>

    <h3>Poker Project</h3>
    <div class="project_des">Poker project randomly select five set of cards of give, and see which set wins based on poker rules(ex. Royal Flush > Full House). The project is written in Python in my Data Structure class.</div>

    <div class="blank2"> </div>

    <h3>Store Management</h3>
    <div class="project_des">The store management project is written in Java and it takes a series of dishes and its price to show on the console when running it. It then asks if the user needs to sell a dish; if so, then the dish will be eliminated from the list. The core of this project is the inheritance of Java class, which expands one parent class into many other classes that share similar features. </div>
